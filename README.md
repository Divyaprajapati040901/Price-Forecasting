**ðŸŒ¾ Groundnut Crop Price Forecasting ðŸ“Š**

**Project Summary:**
This project focuses on forecasting groundnut crop prices using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Given Gujarat's prominence in groundnut production, accurate price forecasting is essential for market stakeholders. Our study uses 14 years of daily price data from Gondal APMC in Gujarat, sourced from the AGMARKNET website.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives:**
Analyze time-series price data for groundnut.
Forecast prices using various models.
Compare model performance using MSE and RMSE metrics.

**ðŸ”¢ Data Overview:**
Study Area: Gujarat, India
Data Source: AGMARKNET (agmarknet.gov.in)
Time Period: January 1, 2010 â€“ November 20, 2024

**ðŸ“Š Methodology:**

**Models Used:**
Statistical Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, ARCH, GARCH, VAR, VARMAX
Machine Learning Model: Random Forest
Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Results:**
Best Performing Model: GRU
MSE: 398.64
RMSE: 10.09%

**Other Insights:**
Random Forest and GRU were the most stable models, with low error rates.
ARCH and GARCH models excelled at capturing data volatility.
LSTM and GRU outperformed statistical models, highlighting the strength of deep learning techniques.

**ðŸš€ Conclusion:**
The GRU model emerged as the most suitable for groundnut price forecasting due to its accuracy and ability to handle complex time-series patterns. Combining statistical and deep learning models can offer robust forecasting solutions for agricultural markets.
